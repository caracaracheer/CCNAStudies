First Hop Redundancy Protocol
	Summary
		Host to next ip address (i.e. router gateway) is the first hop
		If the first hop goes down (i.e. router), the hosts that use that router will go offline.
		FHRP allows hosts to switch to another router quickly so that they remain online.
	Protocols
		HSRP
			Active routers and standby routers.
			Often, devices involved in HSRP deployment are L3 switches, not pure routers.
			However, the theory and commands are the same as on a router.
			1. Routers are placed into a router group
			2. One of the routers in the group is selected as the active router and another is chosen as the standby router
			IP and MAC addresses of physical routers in the group are unknown to downstream devices i.e. hosts
			The hosts communicates through a virtual router that have a MAC and IP address of its own.
