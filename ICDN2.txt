VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)
	Let devices have a synced view of VLANs in the network.
	When one switch joins a VTP domain, it advertises a VTP Ad to other switches. If those switches doesn't belong to a domain already, it will join that domain.
	VTP Modes
		Restrict switches in a VTP domain to certain functions according to its mode.
		You can add ports to a VLAN on all the modes.
		You must have a switch in VTP domain running server mode.
		Server mode
			A switch in server mode can create, delete and modify VLANs.
		Client mode
			Cannot do anything that server mode can do.
		Transparent mode
			A switch in transparent mode does not fully participate in the VTP domain.
			Transparent switches do not sync their VTP database, do not advertise their VLAN information.
			Transparent switches will only forward VTP ads out its other trunks.
		Off mode
			Disable VTP on the switch, the switch will not forward VTP advertisements.
	VTP Advertisement
		VTP ads are multicasts that are sent out only trunk links.
		These ads carry a configuration revision number to advertise the latest VTP version.
		These ads are sent whenever there is a change in the VTP database.
		Process
			1. SW1 makes a VTP change.
			2. SW1 sends VTP ad with CRN increased by 1 to trunk links.
			3. SW2 receives VTP ad and if the CRN is higer, it increase its CRN accordingly as well as update its VTP database.
		*A switch that in going to be inserted to a new VTP domain have to watched carefully.
			If the switch have a higher CRN numbers, it will mess up the other switches updates.
			The switch have to set the CRN to zero.
			CRN is kept in NVRAM.
			To properly ensure CRN is set to zero,
				1. Change the VTP domain name to a nonexistent domain, then change it back to the original anme.
				2. Change the vtp mode from server to transparent, then back to server.
				<write erase> (Remove all configuration files and initialize switch clean.) does not delete vlan.dat which contains vlans information.
				<delete vlan.dat> and <reload> to fully clean switch.
	VTP Password
		VTP passwords are carried in the VTP ads.
		The password of receiving switch must be the same as the password of the switch that advertised.
			*Switches will not update VTP if password does not match the advertised.
			*However, password does not trigger VTP ads. A force update must be done by making a new VLAN and deleting it.
		Commands
			vtp password (password e.g. CCNA)
			vtp password (password e.g. CCNA) hidden
				Only version 3 VTP switches can have encrypted VTP passwords
			show vtp password
	VTP Versions
		Version 1 is run by default.
		It is recommended to run the same VTP versions on all the switches to avoid any compatibility problems.
		Commands
			vtp version (vtp version e.g. 3)
	VTP Pruning
		Switches can block traffic from unnecessary VLANs (block from source) to reduce bandwidth.
		Commands
			vtp pruning
			int x > switchport trunk pruning vlan (vlan number)
				Control which vlan to prune
	Commands
		vtp domain (domain name e.g. CCNA)
		show vtp status

STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)
	L3 routing protocols allow us to use secondary paths in addition to primary paths, making equal and unequal cost load balancing possible.
	L2 routing protocols allow us to use secondary paths but will not use those paths in addition to primary paths.
	STP blocks ports on valid but less desirable paths. STP unblocks these paths when primary paths become unavailable.
	STP analyze port speeds and determine which ports should be open/closed.
	STP will leave one loop-free path between any two endpoints in the switching network.
	Characteristics
		The root port is the port that is connected to the root bridge.
		All port on the root bridge will be on forwarding mode.
		Root ports on non-root-bridge switches are always on forwarding mode.
	Switching Loops
		Happens on layer 2.
		Causes broadcast storm, frame flooding, wasted bandwidth, etc.
	Routing Loops
		Happens on layer 3.
	Port States
		When STP brings a port of blocking mode, it goes to listening mode first before going to forwarding mode.
		Disabled
			You will not see this in show spanning vlan.
			A disabled port is a port that have been administratively shutdown. It will not forward frames or run STP.
		Blocking
			Blocked port can only accept BPDUs from neighbouring switches.
			It cannot forward frames, receive frames therefore no dynamically learning MAC addresses.
		Listening
			A listening port listens for BPDUs and also sends BPDUs and can participate in root bridge election.
			It cannot forward frames, receive frames therefore no dynamically learning MAC addresses.
		Learning
			A learning port is not forwarding frames but it is learning MAC addresses. It can also send and receive BPDUs.
		Forwarding
			Forwarding port forwards and receive frames, send and receive BPDUs and continue to learn MAC addresses.
	Process
		BPDUs and Root Bridge Election.
			STP will determine a root bridge (switch) for every VLAN via an election.
			The election process is carried out via the exchange of BPDUs.
			Only root bridge will originate BPDUs. Non-roots will only receive and forward copies of that BPDU.
			The root bridge will also determine the STP timers.
			Each switch has a Bridge ID (BID). The BID is a combination of a 2-byte priority value and the switch's 6-byte MAC address.
			If the priority is left at default for all switch, the MAC address wil determine the root bridge.
			Ensure that root bridge should be the more powerful switches.
			
			Election Process
				Each switch reads the root bridge BID and compares that with its own.
				If the incoming root bridge BID is lower, it knows that that switch is the root.
				It forwards this information to other switches.
				If not, it wil announce itself as the root.
				This will continue until all switches agrees which is the root.
	STP Timer
		Timers must be change on the root. Timers on non-root with only come into effect when it becomes the root.
		Hello Time
			Defines how often the root bridge originates BPDUs. Default setting: 2 seconds
		Forward Delay
			Length of the listening and learning port stages. This helps protect against switching loops. Default setting: 15 seconds
		Maximum Age
			How long a switch retain BPDU before discarding. Default setting: 20 seconds
		Commands
			spanning vlan (vlan number e.g. 1) forward-time (number of seconds)
			spanning vlan (vlan number e.g. 1) hello-time (number of seconds)
			spanning vlan (vlan number e.g. 1) max-age (number of seconds)
	Port Cost/Root Path Cost
		Every STP-enabled port have an assigned port cost which is used to arrive at the switch's root path cost.
		It is a local value that is not advertised.
		The faster the port, the lower the port cost.
		Root Path Cost
			Refers to the overall cost for the switch to reach the root.
			The configuration BPDU carries the root path cost which increments as the BPDU is forwarded throughout the network.
			RPC increases as BPDU reaches switch NOT when it leaves the switch.
	Commands
		show spanning vlan x
		show spanning-tree vlan x
		show spanning vlan x root
